# Nightscout CLI
A command line interface for interacting with the nightscout glucose server.

Nightscout is a server for collecting information about blood glucose level. I am not personally a fan of the interface, but is somewhat standardized and integrated with the open source mobile app Juggluco so it makes sense to use this. Nightscout provides an API to access data (unlike commercially provided solutions). This tool provides a command line interface suitable for programming simple tools, prototyping and debugging.
